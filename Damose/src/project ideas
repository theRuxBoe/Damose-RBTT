Panels inside the mainframe could be generated forever but we just want to switch between
favourites and normal focus panel, so we have to keep track of their index e/o 
their name ( hence we must save them somewhere)


Favourites logic 
	- stops must be favouritable
	- button on the panel to mark them
	- on the main frame we need a button to open a favourites list to be added on screen 
	- when the app is opened they should appear on the right side

Stop/Bus search panel :
	- JTextField to insert bus/stops number
	- JScrollbar to navigate through buses/stops
	- every bus/stop panel clickable
	- every small panel must have a star to add to favourites
	
Busstop panel focus :
	- after the panel in search panel is clicked, this one is opened below
	- the panel must have :
		- bus stop number
		- JScrollBar of next buses with their arrival time
		- every bus has the number of seats displayed

Bus panel focus :
	- the panel must have :
		- bus number
		- bus direction

Login Panel :
	- hidden (?)
	- exception handling just for flex
	- exception to print a message of various types:
		- the user isn't present in the database
		- the password is too short
		- the password is wrong
		- ...
TODO 
	
	
	Line:
		shows a list of bus stops 
		displays on the map the current buses
		(???) displays the actual line on map (???)
	Bus:
		can be converted into a waypoint on the map 
		shows a panel with its informations BUT it's not focusable, 
		because we don't need to focus on a particular bus but on the stops
	Bus Stop:
		shows a panel with a list of buses with their arrival times	
		shows a waypoint on the map where the stop is
