Waypoints :
	- clickable

	- get updated from bus positions every 30 seconds
	- on top of the map, so one layer over the map level

Stop/Bus search panel :
	- hidden (?)
	- JTextField to insert bus/stops number
	- JScrollbar to navigate through buses/stops
	- every bus/stop panel clickable
	- every small panel must have a star to add to favourites
	
Busstop panel focus :

	- the panel must have :
		- bus stop number
		- JScrollBar of next buses with their arrival time
		- every bus has the number of seats displayed
		- the buses are clickable (hopefully) and they will open a bus panel on top of the busstop one

Bus panel focus :
	- after the bus is clicked this one is opened on the same place as the busstop one

		- ...

	- panels MUST NOT be created on top of one another
	- methods :
		...
	- fields :

TODO 
	I have to think about adding a third panel class for bus lines, because I discovered that buses
	aren't treated as bus lines in the data that's sent from roma mobilità, and that could be why 
	I didn't managed to find a good trade off in their representation
	
	Line:
		shows a list of bus stops (and maybe the current buses) ( and maybe also the actual line on map)
	Bus:
		shows a waypoint on the map and a panel with its informations (id, line, seats, nearest stop (???))
	Bus Stop:
		shows a list of buses with their arrival times	
	

	
TODO
 	should we represent also bus stops?
 	I really think it would be a time wasting job
