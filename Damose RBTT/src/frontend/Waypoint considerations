Inputs :
	-list of buses send by the backend
	- (maybe) the map which will have the waypoints painted
	- 

Outputs : 
	- waypoints on the map
	
Rules :
	- the waypoints on the map must refresh every time the database is updated
	
Steps : 
	1) getting bus list
		1.5) fetching from every bus its geoposition
		1.6) adding it to the list (I think the painter method needs a set)
	2) turning the list into a list of paintable waypoints
		2.5) adding this list as a field on ??? TODO
	3) painting the list of waypoints on the map
	4) repeat from 1) about every 30 seconds
