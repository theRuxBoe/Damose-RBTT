TODO 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
	I have to think about adding a third panel class for bus lines, because I discovered that buses
	aren't treated as bus lines in the data that's sent from roma mobilità, and that could be why 
	I didn't managed to find a good trade off in their representation
	
	Line:
		shows a list of bus stops (and maybe the current buses) ( and maybe also the actual line on map)
	Bus:
		shows a waypoint on the map and a panel with its informations (id, line, seats, nearest stop (???))
	Bus Stop:
		shows a list of buses with their arrival times	
	

	
TODO
 	should we represent also bus stops?
 	I really think it would be a time wasting job
=======
	
	
	Line:
		shows a list of bus stops 
		displays on the map the current buses
		(???) displays the actual line on map (???)
	Bus:
		can be converted into a waypoint on the map 
		shows a panel with its informations BUT it's not focusable, 
		because we don't need to focus on a particular bus but on the stops
	Bus Stop:
		shows a panel with a list of buses with their arrival times	
		shows a waypoint on the map where the stop is
